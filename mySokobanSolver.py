    Sokoban assignment


The functions and classes defined in this module will be called by a marker script. 
You should complete the functions and classes according to their specified interfaces.

No partial marks will be awarded for functions that do not meet the specifications
of the interfaces.

You are NOT allowed to change the defined interfaces.
In other words, you must fully adhere to the specifications of the 
functions, their arguments and returned values.
Changing the interfacce of a function will likely result in a fail 
for the test of your code. This is not negotiable! 

You have to make sure that your code works with the files provided 
(search.py and sokoban.py) as your code will be tested 
with the original copies of these files.

- clarifiy some comments, rename some functions
  (and hopefully didn't introduce any bug!)

def taboo_cells(warehouse):
    '''  
    Identify the taboo cells of a warehouse. A "taboo cell" is by definition
    a cell inside a warehouse such that whenever a box get pushed on such 
    a cell then the puzzle becomes unsolvable. 
    
    Cells outside the warehouse are not taboo. It is a fail to tag an 
    outside cell as taboo.
    
    When determining the taboo cells, you must ignore all the existing boxes, 
    only consider the walls and the target  cells.  
    Use only the following rules to determine the taboo cells;
     Rule 1: if a cell is a corner and not a target, then it is a taboo cell.
     Rule 2: all the cells between two corners along a wall are taboo if none of 
             these cells is a target.
    
    @param warehouse: 
        a Warehouse object with the worker inside the warehouse

    @return
       A string representing the warehouse with only the wall cells marked with 
       a '#' and the taboo cells marked with a 'X'.  
       The returned string should NOT have marks for the worker, the targets,
       and the boxes.

    ###
    # First, understanding what cells are inside the factory:
    #   Check 1: If a cell is empty AND there has been at least 1 cell that denoted a wall before it,
    #            then it is inside the warehouse
    #   Issue 1: All cells outside the warehouse on the right side of the final wall piece will be 
    #            counted incorrectly as inside
    #       Example:
    #
    #           "      # # # #      "    ==     "x x x # # # # o o o"
    #
    #         Where "x" denotes outside and "o" denotes inside
    #
    #       BUT:
    #           When looking at the warehouse .txt files, it appears that no spaces are added after
    #           the final wall in a line like so:
    #
    #           "      # # # #"     ==   "x x x # # # #"
    #
    #           Which is correct in identifying what is outside the warehouse
    #   HENCE Issue 1 is resolved based on the assumption that this occurrence is consistent across all
    #         warehouse .txt files.
    #   
    # Next, understanding how to denote horizontally and vertically adjacent taboo cells
    #   - We know that all corners that are not targets are taboo cells, and any cells between two corners
    #     are also taboo cells if none of them are a target
    #   - To understand if a taboo cell is a corner, all four sides (top, bottom, left and right) need to be
    #     checked for existing walls... if a cell has at least two walls surrounding it, then it is a corner
    #       - It is NOT logical to assume that a cell that is adjacent to one wall is part of a set of cells
    #         between two corners because some walls are standalone or within the confines of the warehouse
    #   - To find other cells that are taboo (cells that are part of a set of cells between two corners where
    #     no target cells lie), simply find the enclosing walls (either vertically or horizontally) and check
    #     if any of the cells between the two walls are targets. If not, then all cells that are enclosed are
    #     classified as taboo
